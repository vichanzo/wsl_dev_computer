# WSL Development Computer
These are my notes and scripts to configure an "out of the box" Windows development laptop set up for programming with WSL and VScode.  This is not meant for broad use, but if it benefits you then I'd be happy to hear about it!

- Notepad++
- winmerge
- winscp
- mRemote (not yet)
- keepass
- 7zip
- git
- vscode
- windows terminal

# Install wsl with a Debian base
- install Docker-CE and docker-ce-cli

# VScode extentions
- Ansible
- Jupyter
- nodejs
- PowerShell
- Remote Development
- Yaml
- Python
